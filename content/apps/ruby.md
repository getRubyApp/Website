Ruby is a beautifully designed news app for iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch. It's built with a familiar design, so it's simple and easy to use and understand. Ruby works great with your devices, and supports iCloud syncing for a seamless experience across all of them.

The app itself has a lot of distinct features, such as being able to choose the topic you want to view on your home feed. If you only want to view technology without the politics, you can. Only interested in sports? There's an option for that too. Ruby has options for what you can view on your feed.

Ruby also offers bookmarks, so you can find an article and come back to it later. We also offer customization. You can easily change the country you're in, or the language you prefer to read.

The built in news reader is easy to understand, and provides content from your favorite websites, but without the advertisements and other nonsense.
Ruby also offers an Apple Watch app, where you can quickly view headlines on your wrist. The Apple Watch app has the same functionality as the iPhone app, so you can easily read headlines of a specific topic, and more.
