## The News

After announcing the [shutdown](https://twitter.com/evergreenapp_/status/1588066238353252358) last night, Dylan McDonald and I have entered an agreement today to transfer ownership of Evergreen. From now on, I will be in charge of Evergreen development.

## What's to come?

While we are not ready to announce anything yet, we will be reviving Evergreen, pushing it to it's true potential. We're excited for the potential!

## Finishing Thoughts
