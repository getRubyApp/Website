After an annoying App Review process, Ruby is now available on visionOS! 

This marks the beginning of a new payment model for Ruby, where we now offer a basic version for free, with ads.

With Ruby Premium, you can unlock even more features, such as topic switching, an ad-free experience, an unlimited number of articles, and more!

Ruby Premium is currently available as a one time purchase for $5.99 for the rest of February. We plan to bring this pricing model to iOS and macOS in March,
and expand it's feature set.
