Surprise! Version 2.0 of Ruby, my news app - is now available, and it’s completely rewritten. Ruby 2.0 will be available at a launch discount for $1.99 for the rest of September, then $2.99 afterwards.

This update was a big rewrite, and added many features like Images in the feed, a redesigned Watch app, a new Explore page, a beautiful new app icon (thanks Aether!) and much more.

Ruby 2.0 is available on the App Store for iOS 16 and watchOS 10 starting today. It’ll be available on macOS Sonoma starting next week. You can download it [here]().

Official changelog: 

- Images are now available on articles that support them! I know this was a highly requested feature, and it's finally here.
- New app icon (as well as a nice assortment of alternatives)
- Apple Watch app redesign! This design embraces watchOS 10 with a much more elegant look.
- New explore page. This page incorporates trending and search in one place.
